## Using the XYZ Editor

The application includes a draggable XYZ structure editor that allows you to:
- View and edit molecular coordinates in XYZ format
- Switch between selection and edit modes
- Select individual atoms in the structure
- Optimize molecular geometry using JSmol's built-in minimization
- Preview changes in real-time in the 3D viewer 
- Save edited structures to XYZ files
- Move the editor window anywhere on screen by dragging its header
- Resize the editor window by dragging its bottom-right corner

To use the editor:
1. Load a molecular structure
2. Click the "Edit XYZ" button
3. Use Selection mode to highlight specific atoms
4. Switch to Edit mode to modify coordinates
5. Click "Optimize Structure" to improve geometry
6. Click "Update Structure" to apply your changes
7. Click "Save XYZ File" to save the current structure

## Orbital Visualization

The orbital viewer provides enhanced visualization of molecular orbitals:
- Interactive orbital list showing energy levels
- Color-coded HOMO and LUMO identifiers
- Keyboard navigation (↑/↓ arrow keys)
- Quick HOMO/LUMO access buttons
- Translucent orbital surface display
- Draggable and resizable control panel

To visualize orbitals:
1. Load a structure with orbital data (e.g., MOLDEN format)
2. Click "Show/Hide Orbitals" button
3. Use arrow keys or buttons to navigate orbitals
4. Click HOMO or LUMO buttons for quick access
5. Select specific orbitals from the energy-sorted list

## 2D Structure Editor (JSME)

The application includes JSME (JavaScript Molecular Editor), providing an integrated 2D structure editing experience:
- Toggle between 3D (JSmol) and 2D (JSME) views with a single click
